Comparison of carbon footprint results of the ecoinvent and exiobase

This code was used to do an extensive comparison of carbon footprints (CF) calculated with the ecoinvent 3.4 cutoff and the hybrid version of exiobase (v3.3.18).
The main steps include:

1) A matching of products in ecoinvent to product groups in exiobase, based on a matching of:
- products
- processes (for electricity)
- geographies
- units

2) Comparison of the carbon footprints of matched products, using a number of metrics, e.g.
- correlations
- relative deviation
- coefficient of variation

Specific analysis are included for specific sectors, such as the power sector.

This is followed by a discussion of 
- the sectoral coverage of both databases
- the comparison of CFs
- implications for database improvement
- reasons for differences
- limitations
