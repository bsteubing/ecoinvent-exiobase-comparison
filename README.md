# ecoinvent-exiobase-comparison
Comparison of carbon footprint results of the ecoinvent and exiobase

This code was used to do an extensive comparison of carbon footprints calculated with the ecoinvent 3.4 cutoff and the hybrid version of exiobase (v3.3.18).
The main steps include:

1) A matching of products in ecoinvent to product groups in exiobase, based on a matching of:
- products
- processes (for electricity)
- geographies
- units

2) Comparison of the carbon footprints of matched products, using a number of metrics, e.g.
- correlations
- relative deviation
- coefficient of variation
